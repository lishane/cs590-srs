     Body="&lt;p&gt;I've not used the Android Emulator but I have set the $http_proxy environment variable for perl and wget and a few cygwin tools on windows. That might work for you for android, but the slash in the domain name seems like a potential problem.&#xA;I know I tried having my domain &quot;GLOBAL&quot; in there, but ended up taking it out and sticking with: &lt;code&gt;http://$USER:password@www-proxy.company.com:80&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One problem I run into a lot though is programs that cannot be told to use the proxy for DNS queries too. In cases where they don't I always get a host name not found. I'd like to find a local dns resolver that can use the proxy for all the programs that won't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"
